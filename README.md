# Printful integration

With Printful, you can focus on building your store. We will print, fulfill and ship the product for you. Simply upload your design, add it to your store and we will do the rest.
We have a range of over 160 products, from t-shirts, leggings, and hats to posters, mugs, and beanbags. We'll fulfill and ship every order in-house, on-demand, and in an average of 3 business days at our locations in California, North Carolina, Mexico, and Europe.

## HOW DOES PRINTFUL WORK?
When a customer buys something from your PrestaShop store, the order is automatically imported to Printful, where we fulfill and ship it to them under your brand. You can then see your order, revenue and profit statistics on your PrestaShop dashboard.
